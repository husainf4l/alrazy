# BoT-SORT tracker configuration with ReID enabled for multi-camera tracking
# Based on Ultralytics best practices for cross-camera people counting

# Tracker type (do not change)
tracker_type: botsort

# Detection thresholds
track_high_thresh: 0.5    # High confidence threshold for first association
track_low_thresh: 0.1     # Low confidence threshold for second association
new_track_thresh: 0.6     # Threshold to create new track

# Track management
track_buffer: 30          # Number of frames to keep lost tracks (1 second at 30fps)
match_thresh: 0.8         # Matching threshold for IoU distance

# Re-identification (ReID) - CRITICAL for multi-camera tracking
with_reid: true           # Enable ReID for cross-camera matching
proximity_thresh: 0.5     # Minimum IoU for valid ReID match
appearance_thresh: 0.25   # Minimum appearance similarity for ReID

# ReID model configuration
model: auto               # Use YOLO native features (fast, minimal overhead)
                          # Alternative: yolo11n-cls.pt for better embeddings

# Global motion compensation
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow # sparseOptFlow, ecc, orb, sift, or None
                          # sparseOptFlow is good for static cameras

# Score fusion
fuse_score: true          # Fuse confidence scores with IoU distances
