## 🚀 **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Backend Integration Points**
```
Frontend ←→ Backend API Endpoints
├── Auth: POST /api/v1/auth/login
├── Users: GET /api/v1/companies/:id/users
├── Cameras: POST /api/v1/cameras
├── Camera Access: POST /api/v1/cameras/:id/access
└── Access Revocation: DELETE /api/v1/cameras/:id/access/:userId
```

### **Component Hierarchy**
```
Dashboard
├── UsersComponent (User Management)
├── CameraAccessManagement (Access Control)
├── CameraManagement (Camera CRUD)
└── Settings (AI Detection & Alerts)
```

### **Data Flow**
```
AuthContext → Services → Components → UI
     ↓
User Authentication → Company Data → Camera Management → Access Control
```
